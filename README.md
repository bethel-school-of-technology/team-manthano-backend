Navigate to our working dev branch. This will be our main development branch so push and merge all code to this branch. Run "git checkout dev". This switches your branch to the dev branch. Then run "git pull". This will pull the latest code from the dev branch.
Then to make a new branch from the current branch, run "git checkout -b new_branch_name". Substitute new_branch_name for whatever card you're working on.
Make changes and write code.
Once you're ready to push your changes up, run "git add .". This will add every file you changed to your commit.
Make sure to add a message with your commit so that everyone knows what was done. Run "git commit -m "My commit message here"
To switch back to the dev branch, run "git checkout dev"
Then to finally merge the featured branch that you were working on with the dev branch, run 'git merge new_branch_name'
Then push up to the remote repo. Run 'git push'
Before starting on another card, make sure to run 'git pull' again from the dev branch to make sure you're working with the latest code and then repeat all of the steps again.
